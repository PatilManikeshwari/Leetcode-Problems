Given a string s and an integer k, reverse the first k characters for every 2k characters counting from the start of the string.

If there are fewer than k characters left, reverse all of them. If there are less than 2k but greater than or equal to k characters, then reverse the first k characters and leave the other as original.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abcdefg", k = 2
Output: "bacdfeg"
Example 2:

Input: s = "abcd", k = 2
Output: "bacd"

Solution--

class Solution:
    def reverseStr(self, s: str, k: int) -> str:
        answer = "" # consider an empty string
        for i in range(0,len(s),2*k):
            answer += s[i:i+k][::-1] # add reversed string of length k
            answer += s[i+k:i+2*k] # add string of length k
        return answer
